Experimentations in Work Ethic

1. The best chefs finish cleaning up the last onion before chopping the next one.
2. Maintain test coverage above 80% before moving on to the next feature.
3. This takes discipline.
4. Take your time; do it right; your future self thanks you.
5. Foundations first.
6. Make development engaging; developers are the first users of this code - they write it.
7. Remove obstacles to smooth development; prioritize that over feature work.
8. We don't know whether this is going to work or not.
9. Give it your best shot and see what happens.
10. Follow best practices.
11. Refactor!

> In the short term, things take far longer that we expect them to take.

12. Commit everything to trunk.
13. If it seems important to you, make your commits atomic/revertable.
14. If you don't care whether we revert stuff together, make your commits messy.
15. One day we'll have a CHANGELOG.md.
16. Until then, we trust you to commit to trunk.
