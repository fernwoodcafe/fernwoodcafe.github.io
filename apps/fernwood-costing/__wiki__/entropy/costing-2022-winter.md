## Insights / Ideas / Brainstorming

The Works:

* Base price for mocha and hotchocolate with `Add $0.25 for The Works`.

3.5 Markup on Digestibles:

* Base price for drinks items with `Add 0.50 To Go`.
* Those keep the base price low and educate the customer about costs.
* Also, the packaging does not add much labour, so we can keep its markup down.
* Thus, we put the markup _only_ on what the customer _digests_.
