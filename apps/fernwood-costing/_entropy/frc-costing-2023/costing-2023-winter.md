## Insights / Ideas / Brainstorming

The Works:

- Base price for mocha and hotchocolate with `Add $0.25 for The Works`.

  3.5 Markup on Digestibles:

- Base price for drinks items with `Add 0.50 To Go`.
- Those keep the base price low and educate the customer about costs.
- Also, the packaging does not add much labour, so we can keep its markup down.
- Thus, we put the markup _only_ on what the customer _digests_.
- The cup/lid/sleeve costs us $0.40 and adds $1.40 to our customer price!

Rebranding:

- Rename the cafe to Alchemy to reflect the _chemistry_ aspect of food prep.
- Biochemistry.
- Coffistry.
