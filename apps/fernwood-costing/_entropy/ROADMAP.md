# Brainstorming

As a user, from the Menu Item View, I would like to edit a supply. Currently, I need to click back
to the Supplies View and find the supply. I would like a faster way to navigate to the supply. For
instance, I would like to click on the supply from the Menu Item View and either have an edit modal
or have direct navigation to the supply in the Supplies View.

As a user, from the Supplies View, I would like to see which Menu Items use the supply. It would also
help to see a count of how many Menu Items use the supply. Then, I would like to click on that Menu
Item and have direct navigation to it.

As a user, I would like to use multiple tabs at the same time and have them stay in sync. [multi-tab]

As a user, on the Menu Item View, I would like to see Ingredient Cost, Packaging Cost, Total Cost as
separate costs.

As a user, on the Menu Item View, I would like to add arbitrary notes to the bottom of the Menu Item;
for instance, I would like to add a note saying "Whipping Cream has a 1:2 ratio for Fluid:Whipped" or
that "Mocha at Drumroasters costs $7.00 for comparision - comparative pricing."

As a user, I would like to be able to put in fractions to the numeric fields.
