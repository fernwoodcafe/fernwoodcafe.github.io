* Menu items have components.
* Menu item components can be ingredients or packaging.
* Menu item components have units such as grams that refer to how we use them.
* Outside of a menu item, we call these components 'supplies' (not inventory).
* We do not call them inventory, because inventory means what we currently have on hand.
* Supplies have units such as grams or ounces that refers to how we purchase them.
* Supply units often differ from menu item component units.
* For instance, we may buy coffee by the pound but use it in a menu item by the gram.
* Supplies have a unit cost such as $1/gram or $10/ounce.
